Dear <%= @guardian.fullname %>,

You are receiving this email because your name and email was entered
into the Churchill Alternative School student directory system.

In contrast to previous years where this was all done with paper which
was then put into a computer system, starting in 2012, the system has
moved to a web based system.

You may have concerns about the security of the system, and you can read
more about it at: 
   http://www.churchillnews.ca/story/about-churchill-alternative-school-student-directory

In this email you will find a link to the web site.
At our web site you will be asked to confirm your email address, and
desire to proceed with the opt-in process.  
 
If you decide to opt-in, you will receive another email that will permit
you to review the information that we have, and that of your child(ren).
As it is likely that we have some email addresses wrong or which are invalid,
this two step process keeps us from disclosing your information to the wrong
person. 

You may opt-out at any point, and if you do nothing, it will be an opt-out.

If you are receiving this email in error: you have never had children
at Churchill, or your children are no longer at Churchill, it would help
us weed out wrong information if you would use the wrong-email link.

START OPT-IN PROCESS:
	<%= optin_guardian_url(@guardian, :magic => @guardian.magictoken) %>


REPORT ERROR IN EMAIL:
